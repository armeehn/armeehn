## Salutations! Welcome to my GitHub profile.
I am an incoming Master's student at the University of British Columbia [Okanagan campus](https://ok.ubc.ca/) where I will be working under the supervision of [Yves Lucet](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/ylucet/) and [Warren Hare](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/warren-hare/). I will be pursuing an MSc. in (applied) mathematics. I recently graduated *virtually* from McGill University with a BSc. in mathematics and computer science in the spring of 2020.

### Research

**Current**: Various research topics in the realm of Deep Learning: confidence metrics + novel SGD testing.

*Upcoming*: Optimization for road design applications

#### Past (includes):
- Optimal Transporation (see [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-020-01143-x))
    - I worked with [Adam M. Oberman](https://adamoberman.net) and [Levon Nurbekyan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Levon_Nurbekyan2) to develop an ad hoc algorithm for approximating the OT solution in R<sup>n</sup>, n > 1; it fares well empirically using common distance metrics such at \U+2113<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>2</sub> and l<sub>&infin;</sub>
    - Further details can be found below (to come)
- Machine Learning: adversarial robustness + attacks

### Interests
- Optimization
- Optimal Transport
- Numerical Methods
- Machine Learning
- Distributed + Parallel Computing

### Other Information

- In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering, the outdoors (mainly through skiing and cycling) and listening to music. I would be pleased to work on some projects in the vain of [N-O-D-E](https://n-o-d-e.net/)'s, creating customized software for products that I use such a Garmin Edge for cycling or a Casio watch.
