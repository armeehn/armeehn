## Salutations! Welcome to my GitHub profile.
I am an incoming Master's student at the University of British Columbia [Okanagan campus](https://ok.ubc.ca/) where I will be working under the supervision of [Yves Lucet](link) and [Warren Hare](link). I will be pursuing an MSc. in (applied) mathematics. I graduated *virtually* from McGill University with a BSc. in mathematics and computer science in the spring of 2020.

### Research

**Current**: Various research topics in the realm of Deep Learning

*Upcoming*: Using optimization techniques for road design applications
#### Past (includes):
- Optimal Transporation (see [here]())
    - Worked with [Adam M. Oberman](https://adamoberman.net) and [Levon Nurbekyan](link) to develop an ad hoc algorithm for approximating the OT solution in &#8477;<sup>n</sup>, n > 1; it fares well empirically using common distance metrics
    - Further details can be found below (to come)
- Machine Learning: adversarial robustness + attacks

### Interests
- Optimization
- Optimal Transport
- Numerical Methods
- Machine Learning
- Distributed + Parallel Computing

### Other Information

- In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering. I would be pleased to work on some projects in the vain of [N-O-D-E](https://n-o-d-e.net/)'s, creating customized software for products that I use such a Garmin Edge for cycling or a Casio watch.
- One can obtain more information about my work, interests and other particulars on my [personal website](https://alexander.iannantuono.org)
