Hi! 

I'm a software developer at Softree Technical Systems, where I develop road design/modelling software.

I obtained my MSc in mathematics from UBC - Okanagan, working [Dr. Yves Lucet](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/ylucet/) and Dr. Warren Hare, and BSc in mathematics and computer science at McGill.

### Research

Current: Fuel consumption optimization + modelling for industrial applications

Past:
- Penalty methods in continuous optimization for applications in road design
- Confidence metrics in DNNs
- Optimal Transportation (see [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-020-01143-x))
- Machine Learning: adversarial robustness + attacks

#### Academic Interests
- Applications in mathematical optimization
- Optimal Transport
- Numerical Methods
- Distributed Computing

#### Misc.
- I like tinkering and the outdoors (mainly through skiing and cycling).
- The pronunciation of my surname is [ja.nan.'two.no].
